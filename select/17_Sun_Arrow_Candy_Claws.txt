Close to where stream flows half hidden
Hear it in valley going slowly
Glimpses in grass show maybe
Something else is there

Sun arr-, sun arrow

The wonder of seeds in fruit to eat
The lands of the trees in view, it's wide
Begin discover
In the canopy birds sing it right

Understory home half hidden
See it with love eyes looking lower
Glimpses in leaves see maybe
Something else is there

Sun arr-, sun arrow

The wonder of seeds in fruit to eat
The lands of the trees in view, it's wide
Begin discover
In the canopy birds sing it right
